## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/stasmaxs-projects/v0-dwell-well-landing-page](https://vercel.com/stasmaxs-projects/v0-dwell-well-landing-page)**

## Image optimization (WebP)

Images are referenced as `.webp` for better performance. After cloning or before first build, generate WebP files from sources in `public/images`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run images:webp
```

This converts all `.jpg` and `.png` in `public/images` to `.webp` (originals are kept).

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/mYxbj4trpkv](https://v0.app/chat/mYxbj4trpkv)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository
